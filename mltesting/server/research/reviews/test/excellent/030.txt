5.0

It has good reception and nice audio.The keyboard is pretty good, not as firm as other phones, but comparable to the other keyboards.

The one that I have is obviously for the world market, since it has some added European chars and symbols on the keypad.

Wi-fi works fine, and Opera Mini installed and runs without problems - good way to go for a bit of web-surfing. I did not tried any of the e-mail or social clients.

Text messaging can be set to 'normal' in-box or conversation modes. There are a couple of features that I found appealing: ability to backup the phone memory to the sd card; ability to lock the keypad with a passcode either manually or automatically after a set time.

The battery is fairly good sized.
