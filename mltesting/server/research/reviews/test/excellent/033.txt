5.0

I bought this phone as a Christmas present for myself because I wanted something a bit more advanced than the previous one.

I purchased it, but didn't want to go all the way with a smartphone. In other words, a good feature phone. I've had it for a week and it works great.

It has the great calendar, alarm clock, text messaging, camera, missed/received call and other features , which makes it a keeper.

And it's a little bigger, with a wider screen, but not so big it can't fit into my pocket or purse. I can use the same charer I had.
