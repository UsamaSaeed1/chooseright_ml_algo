I feel so LUCKY to have found this used (phone to us & not used hard at all), phone on line from someone who upgraded and sold this one. My Son liked his old one that finally fell apart after 2.5+ years and didn't want an upgrade!! Thank you Seller, we really appreciate it & your honesty re: said used phone.I recommend this seller very highly & would but from them again.
