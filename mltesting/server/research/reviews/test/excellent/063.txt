5.0

This is like the 5th cellphone for my dad in less than a year.

Well my first impressions as i recieved the cellphone in the mail is the keypad.

I really like that the numbers are huge.

And also the display is quite clear and crispy and simple to understand. He had no problem adjusting to this new device.It has a FM radio which does not need headphones to work it has a camera which is OK not the best but plausible. It has an SD slot for media. But it cannot play music nor the videos files they dont show up when i try search the folders in the memory. I like that it has an LED light to alert him of any notifications which is a plus and the ringtones are pretty loud too. Good pick for aging parents.
