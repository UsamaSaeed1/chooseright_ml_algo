3.0

So, after having the Ascend mate 2 for about a month, I figured I should update my review.

I'm sure this was a nice phone when it first came out, however, Huawei needs to come out with a new phone for the U.S. he phone comes with out of date software.

Huawei has responded with an update available through download that takes up more than 1gb of space, and its quite a lengthy process.

They do not do automatic updates like samsung, apple, lg, etc. It's a huge headache.

I've also found that it is a little laggy in comparison to my note 4.

I have also not had any luck turning off haptic feedback on the keyboard. For me, this is pretty annoying.

The camera in my opinion is not as good as you would think either.I think the only upsides to this phone at this point is that you can use a micro SD card in this phone, and I will say the battery life is top notch.

I use this phone alot, and only need to charge it after 1.5 days of usage.
