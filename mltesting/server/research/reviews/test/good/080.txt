The phone works well. It's cheap obviously. It was delivered very quickly (I live in Atlanta, GA USA).

Battery is weak especially when the brightness of screen is high.

I had this phone for a few months and I still have some problems with the touch screen (maybe my fingers are a little thick, but I don't have this problem with iphone).
