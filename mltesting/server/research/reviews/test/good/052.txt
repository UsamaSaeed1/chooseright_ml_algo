4.0

This is probably one of the best deals out there.

I installed Cyanogenmod on it right away and it was super easy. Battery life is incredible.

Only cons are:1. The vibrate is pretty low powered, I can never feel it when it is all the way up2.

The battery cannot be easily removed3. The camera does not focus well and there is a lot of blurring line it's 1/30 shutter speedOther than that, great phone for a great price!
