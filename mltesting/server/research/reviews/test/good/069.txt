3.0

No headphones were in the package.

The phone arrive with no charge on the battery.

Battery drains quickly probably less than 4 hours

No paperwork on warranty. Works good but not an exceptal phone.

The battery is going to be a problem so might send it back. 4 Hours is too short. If you have to leave it plugged in all the time it is not a cell phone but a home phone.
