3.0

I loved this phone...for the brief time that I had it in my possession.

Can't beat the price for what you get, the speed was great and the screen was very beautiful.

Sadly, one week into ownership I was hit with the dreaded "permanent restart" bug that I've heard of other phone owners experiencing. It made the phone restart one time after another until the battery was dead.

I hoped that that might reset it, but when I plugged it back in there was no fix. I had to return it and now I have a Moto G LTE, which works great.

No bugs. I was using the T-Mobile LTE network in the Memphis, TN area and I always got reliable, fast downloads.

This is a great phone if you want to be aware of the bugs you might experience. I will allow that I may have gotten the one faulty unit our of a production volume of several thousand, but it put a bad taste in my mouth, which is why I went with the Moto G LTE.
