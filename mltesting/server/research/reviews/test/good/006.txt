4.0

I love the phone. It does everything I need and works great. I purchased four of these phones through a seller that shipped from Amazon's warehouse.

My only problem is that the phone didn't come with a micro sd card. I couldn't use the camera until I got the card. No problems getting these activated at Sprint.
