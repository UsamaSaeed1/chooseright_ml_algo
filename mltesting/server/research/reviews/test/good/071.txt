3.0

Performance and value were mediocre.

I used this several months before the screen cracked from a slight drop, so the durability is perhaps not outstanding.

I wouldn't buy it again, and I feel the value is not compelling in the face of superior alternatives at this point.

Updates and support also seem underwhelming. Opening the camera app and waiting between shots was notably laggy and results were usually blurry. The speaker was tinny for media.

The casing was nice enough, and the battery life was also decidedly mediocre.

As a positive, the Android installation on it didn't have a bunch of add-on junk like many companies load on their phones.

This unit broke about a month ago for me, and here in the US, they had STILL yet to release the Android Marshmallow update for it, despite the update rolling out for European customers in May.

Perhaps they've gotten around to it by now, but I personally won't be buying any more Huawei products.

Unless you get this at an especially amazing price, I would look at newer Huawei models or competing offerings before considering such a mediocre device.
