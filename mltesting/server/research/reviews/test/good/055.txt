3.0

Listen this is a really cool phone. Don't get me wrong.

However, you cannot use with enterprise services if they require encryption.

That normal standard android function is completely missing from settings (under both security and storage).

Needless to say my husband is quite happy as he has a new nifty phone to play with. Sigh.

Lovely screen, on screen key board worked well, acts as a tethering/highspot. Off to find a new phone for me as husband does the "I got your phone" dance.
