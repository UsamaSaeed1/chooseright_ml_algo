4.0

Love this phone! It is fast. Camera is better than the last phone ( galaxy light). It is slick looking.

Battery life is the same as previous phone,it dies by end of day (evening). I charge it overnight.

No improvement as far as battery. All in all, Great phone!! Perfect size, fast, decent camera , and slick looking! Would recommend!! Also has a heart monitor..
