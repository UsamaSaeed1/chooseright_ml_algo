1.0

I already had a phone with problems.I know it stated it was used, but dang, it did not state that it did not charge.

I wish i would have read these comments then i would have not purchased this item and its cracked on the side.

If trying to charge it another way does not work,i am requesting for my money back.

I will get my money back.It is a poor product.Signed an unhappy customer.
