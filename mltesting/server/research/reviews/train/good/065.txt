3.0

its a slower phone, i got a moto g 2nd gen for like 50-90 bucks cheaper last year, its way faster than this, good brighter and had better sounds.

I wanted to try this phone because it looked so good, its not. I would not recommend getting it if you want a cheaper phone go to the moto's its cheap and way faster.

The only thing i liked about it is the design, its drop dead nice looking.
