4.0

Pros-beautiful screen,capable of running chrome,take good pictures,the keyboard is comfy,fits in my pocket and fit my hands,plays really good videos and gamescons-no Bluetooth,came late,run down fast really quick,doesnt play 1080p videos.

But I would still recommend it to those who like to talk and text a lot like me and watch a lot of movies because it is a nice product.
