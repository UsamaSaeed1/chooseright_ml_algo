4.0

Good battery life, but speed is a little slow, I like the 6" screen.

Resolution is more than good enough. The power button is in a bad place.. when holding you can turn it off accidentally.

Mono recording is blah... I love the beautiful and panoramic selfie at 5MP. 

Photo cameras are just as good as any other phone.
