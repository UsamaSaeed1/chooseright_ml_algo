4.0

This is a great phone, came exactly as advertised.

All the the main features (including 4G LTE work on the T-Mobile network, but)-Upgrade from KitKat to Lollipop is not possible with a T-Mobile Sim (Likely possible if you swap in an AT&T Sim, I haven't had a chance to try.-WiFi HotSpot/Tethering will not work with a T-Mobile Sim-This device cannot be rooted (most other G850's can--not the a)-There are no mods offered for this (Cyanogen, etc.)All this can be a bit frustrating, but if you just want a good Android phone at a fair price, you can't beat it.

The size is great, the cameras are decent, the removable battery is a plus, the screen is good, power-saving mode is helpful. Would definitely recommend to a user who doesn't want the latest Android update.
