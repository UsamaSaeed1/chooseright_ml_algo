4.0

I bought it for my mom who is in her late 70s after her other highest rated "senior" phone stopped working.

I hated that other phone as it was very confusing for me to operate the menu functions. So I took a chance on this one despite some of the complaints I read about in the reviews.

Some of those problems have been addressed and corrected. It is no longer difficult to lock or unlock the keys. 

You press the lower left button down for a couple of seconds and the word locked comes up, I assume, since that's what it says in Spanish. I set my mom's phone to Spanish. There is a second way of doing it with a directional key, but we didn't need to try it since my mom got it right away. And she is definitely not good with technology.

Another complaint was about the clock being set to military, or 24 hr time. Well, you can now choose to set it to 12 hr.

The phone was easy to set, which was a relief for me, compared to her previous phone. Let's face it, it's the non seniors who will probably have to set it up. Sometimes in an effort to simplify phones, they take away buttons which makes them harder to navigate.

The phone is very light weight. The ringer is loud enough. I like the cradle, which is easier for a senior. You can't beat the price. It worked well with the SIM card.

On the negative side, I will agree with one complaint, it's not loud enough. I turned the volume all the way up and was afraid mom would not be able to hear the caller. She agreed to give it a chance, but we may have to exchange it since her hearing is not great.

The back cover is thin plastic and I was afraid to break it when I removed it. I wish it had an alarm.When it comes to "senior" phones, it's slim pickings.

This one is half the price of the old one and comes close to meeting all the requirements. Since most seniors are hard of hearing, they really need to make it louder.
