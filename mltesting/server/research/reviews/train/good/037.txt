Word to the wise: Check with the seller for the type of service this phone does NOT work with if you are technically challenged like I am.

I learned something new - "unlocked" is not "unlocked" for all mobile service carriers, like Sprint. It would have been helpful to read that in the product description before purchasing.

It seems like a perfect phone for seniors. Apparently I was having a senior moment when I ordered it.
