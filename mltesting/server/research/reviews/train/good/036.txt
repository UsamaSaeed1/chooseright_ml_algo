This is a great, simple phone which is getting to be harder and harder to find.

For those who do NOT want a smartphone and just need a phone for an elderly family member or for someone who is not tech savvy, this is a great little phone.

I gave it four stars, though because our carrier - AT&T - does not recognize the signature of this phone, so we wound up having to buy an AT&T friendly phone.

The phone works, but when we are billed their system would automatically charge this as a smartphone - which is an extra $40 on our bill - since it did not recognize the signature :/ We will be giving it to the military to reuse.
