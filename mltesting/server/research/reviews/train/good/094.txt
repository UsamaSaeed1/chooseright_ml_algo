It is unlocked and it works great with T-Mobile right outta the box! One down fall imo is that it comes shipped with KitKat so I'm stuck w KK lame but there is an update 5.0.2 out according to at&t and Samsung website.

Anyone figure out how to get a forced upgrade would you be so kind to reply and share here and comment thank you.
