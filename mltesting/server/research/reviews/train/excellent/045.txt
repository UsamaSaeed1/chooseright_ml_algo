5.0

I have enjoyed my Nokia C3 phone for a few years, but it was tired and needed an update.

This smartphone is just that all of simple goodness, with a much higher quality set of hardware.

The screen is sharper, processor faster, phone takes nice clear pictures that are very good enough.

The ring and alert tones are more discreet and professional.

Anyway if you want a phone that texts very easily, has a 4-day battery.
