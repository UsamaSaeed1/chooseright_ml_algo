5.0

Have a family member who has ZERO interest in learning anything tech.

Years ago gave her an old T-Mobile pre paid flip phone. I had kept it for years as a backup phone.

To her it was perfect. She did not want to learn anything else.

This phone is much better and awesome then others for use.
