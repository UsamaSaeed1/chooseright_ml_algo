5.0

This is like the 5th cellphone for my dad in less than a year.

Well my first impressions as i recieved the cellphone in the mail is the keypad.

I really like that the numbers are huge.

And also the display is quite clear and crispy and simple to understand. He had no problem adjusting to this new device. I like that it has an LED light to alert him of any notifications which is a plus and the ringtones are pretty loud too.

Very good pick for aging parents.
