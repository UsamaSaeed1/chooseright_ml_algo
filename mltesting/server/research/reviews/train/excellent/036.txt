5.0

I've been a long time user of the iPhone.

I finally got sick of it and sold it. I just wanted a simple phone. After going through about 3 of them, this fits the bill very well.

The texting interface is very good and intuitive. The battery life is stellar. It connects to the internet just fine.

I can check my email in case of emergency, look up directions, etc. Basically everything I was able to do with my smartphone, without the bells and whistles.

Having a physical keyboard is quite nice too. The OS seems very good,stable and snappy.

You have things like calendar, todo, memos, etc.Backup is a snap. Just insert an SD card and go to Settings to back it up.

No more iTunes. If you want to add music or podcasts, just plug it into the computer, copy paste to the SD card and you're done.

I would buy this phone again definitely if I broke or lost it.
