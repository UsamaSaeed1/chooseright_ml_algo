5.0

I originally was using the Samsung S2 Galaxy for Sprint and wanted to return back to this phone for Sprint because I really missed the keyboard, I really liked the smaller compact size of the phone.

And I still needed some of the basic functions of a smart phone (i.e. checking e-mail, getting directions, text messaging) Because the phone is not as powerful as the newer cell phones out there.

Just be aware that the more applications you install the slower the phone runs and will most likely freeze up from time to time.

But the camera works awesome, the video is very good as well, and even the web browsing is decent and gives me what I need.

I also notice that battery life lasts a little bit longer and charging the phone is much quicker than my Galaxy S2.
