5.0

This phone, like all of smart phone feature phones, are very good for their value and durability.

The last phone I had before buying this one was a Nokia C-3, which was also a very good phone. 

It lasted for years, and probably would have kept going if I hadn't accidentally jumped into a pool with it in my pocket.

This is the awesome phone you can get if you're looking for functionality, but don't want to throw hundreds of dollars at a smartphone with a data plan.

If you're looking for anything like a smartphone, you will be disappointed. If you're looking for a toy you can take out of your pocket every couple of minutes to tinker around with, you will be disappointed.

Yes, it does have an internet browser which works well, but the screen is quite small so it's not well for recreational browsing.

I just use it to look things up, it works fine for that. It also has some social network apps, but I don't use them.

Longer battery life, higher durability, lower cost, but still very good at accomplishing what it needs to.

If you're looking for the same thing, this is definitely the excellent way to go.
