5.0

I'm not a fan of touchscreen phones but when my trusted Nokia E71 gave up the ghost, I had to make that transition.

This phone meets my needs. Nothing fancy, very good size,fits perfectly in my palm and I can finally download "Whatsapp".

My siblings and friends have teased me to no end about not having a smartphone to download the app.I'm really not into specs but my husband, who is techy, took a look at the description and confirmed it would be perfect for my needs.

I've had it for 4 days now and so far so very good.

Will update the review if anything changes. And I love the purple color.
